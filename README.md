## Installing the CLI tool

```
composer global require statamic/cli
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the `statamic` executable can be located by your system. This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:

- MacOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`

Once installed, you should be able to run `statamic {command name}` from within any directory.

## Using the CLI tool

### Installing Statamic

You may create a new Statamic site with the `new` command:

```
statamic new my-site
```

This will download the latest version and install it into the `my-site` directory.

### Installing Statamic from a Starter Kit

You may create a new Statamic site from a Starter Kit with the `new` command and the `--starter` option:

```
statamic new my-site --starter
```

This will present you with a list of supported starter kits to select from.

You may also pass an explicit starter kit repo if you wish to skip the selection prompt:

```
statamic new my-site --starter="statamic/starter-kit-cool-writings"
```

### Checking Statamic versions

From within an existing Statamic project root directory, you may run the following command to quickly find out which version is being used.

```
statamic version
```

### Updating Statamic

From within an existing Statamic project root directory, you may use the following command to update to the latest version.

```
statamic update
```

This is just syntactic sugar for the `composer update statamic/cms --with-dependencies` command.
